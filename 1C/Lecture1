# CS50 - Lecture 1 - C

## Transition from Scratch to C
Textual representation. Purple Scratch part is a function.
in C: printf("Whatever\n"); is an example structure.
You need some structure to set up your code: int main(void){}
"Whatever\n" is called a String.

#include <stdio.h> // file with standard input/output functions

int main(void)
{
    printf("Whatever\n");
}

## forever (Scratch) equals while-loop c

while (true) // true is a boolean
{
    printf("hello, world\n");
}

## repeat x equals for

for (int i = 0; i < x; i++)
{
    printf("hello, world\n")
}

... other c-constructs I all ready now: if-else

## Source Code
Source code like the shown helloworld program is translated by an compiler to
machine code (0011101101....)
Use CS50 IDE to write your code and compile it.

## Write files
Convention in C: Always use small letters, don't use spaces, end every Source
code file ends with .c
The IDE has an terminal window where you can use clang (clang hello.c -> a.out)
In a.out the code is saved in machine code.
"\n" stands for a newline. To name a compiled file (clang -o hello hello.c). -o
is a commandline option which stands for output
... I stopped noting everything because I am all ready familar wiht C and linux
command line
